2-3 sentence description of what you are doing for the project.

Of the two options for the final project we are implementing the search engine for twitter. We will be creating this search engine using python, lucene, and various libraries to help with the twitter APIs. 

However in case python doesn't achieve what we hope for, we can attempt to create this search engine using various libraries including but not limited to twitter4j, api.twitter, etc. in java, but it will be our first time using such language.
